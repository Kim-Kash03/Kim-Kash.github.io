  TEXT ANALYSIS WEBPAGE PROJECT
======================================

Description:

Assumptions:
------------
1. The project is intended to run locally in a modern web browser.
2. All code is self-contained in a single HTML file (no server or backend).

4. Basic styling and interactivity are based on HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript only.
5. The text analysis is done using regular expressions and JavaScript string processing.
